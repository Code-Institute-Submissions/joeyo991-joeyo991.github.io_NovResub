# User Experience

## Site Structure

The 121 Fitness website has three pages: The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, the [plans](plans.html) and [sign up](sign-up.html) pages are accessible primarily from the navigation bar. There are other link to the plans page in the 'reasons' section and below the 'about' section. There is also a link to the sign up page below the plans. These give the user some guidance to the next step of the journey.

## Design Choices

  * ### Typography
      The chosen fonts were 'Roboto' for the headings and 'Montserrat' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serfif.
      * 'Roboto' was chosen because it is a very clean and easy to read font. It looks great in bold and thus is perfect for the headings.
      * 'Montserrat' is used for the body text as it to is easy to read and also looks fantastic paired with the 'Roboto' font.
  
  * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on white, black and a pigment of orange called 'Gamboge'. The colours make the site easy to read and also look very stylish when paired together.
