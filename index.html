        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div id="about-text">
            <p>My name is John Smith and I am the founder and fitness expert behind 121 Fitness. With 15 years of gym experience and a degree in both sports science and nutrition, there is nobody better to learn from. Starting off as a small business to help family and friends, 121 Fitness has grown and now has over 300 clients in Ireland and the UK. I have always been into fitness, first joining a gym at age 16. My friends saw how healthy, happy and dedicated I looked and asked me to help them be the same. At first I did it for free because I enjoyed it, but as more and more people came to me for help, I realised there was an oppurtunity for me to make a career out of this. I can now say I have made a career out of this and enjoyed every minute of it, and so have my clients. Check out some of their reviews below. I look forward to working with you!</p></p>
