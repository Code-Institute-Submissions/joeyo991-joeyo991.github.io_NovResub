        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div id="about-text">
            <p>My name is John Smith and I am the founder and fitness expert behind 121 Fitness. With 15 years of gym experience and a degree in both sports science and nutrition, there is nobody better to learn from. Starting off as a small business to help family and friends, 121 Fitness has grown and now has over 300 clients and 25 employees accross Ireland and the UK. I have always been into fitness, first joining a gym at age 16. My friends saw how healthy, happy and dedicated I looked and asked me to help them be the same. At first I did it for free because I enjoyed it, but as more and more people came to me for help, I realised there was an oppurtunity for me to make a career out of this. I can now say I have made a career out of this and enjoyed every minute of it, and so have my clients. Check out some of their reviews below. I look forward to working with you!</p></p>

        <h2>Client Reviews</h2>
        <div>
            <p>"121 Fitness has given me my life back. When I first signed up I was nearly 350lbs, 2 and a half years later and I am 210lbs. My plan made sure I didn't rush anything but instead I was doing everything right. The plans are easy to follow and they work!"</p>

            <p>"I was going to the gym for 3 years without seeing any results. A friend told me about 121 Fitness so I reached out and straight away the team pointed out that my diet was all wrong. I'm 6 months into my nutrition plan and I have seen amazing progress. Thank you 121 Fitness!"</p>

            <p>"Working in a restaurant made my eating and exercise habits terrible for 11 years, but thanks to my new plan from 121 Fitness, I'm eating better, training better and feeling better. I have never been happier, 5 stars!"</p>
